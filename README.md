Hello! This is my first take into DevOps in 2021!

First try!
Got the error "We couldnâ€™t deliver this payload: cannot validate certificate for XXYYZZ because it doesn't contain any IP SANs"

Second try!
Another try!

Modified the webhook configuration to http and Contenttype  application/json and it says it works on github. Retrying.
